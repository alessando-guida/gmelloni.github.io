My name is Giorgio, currently postdoc and data scientist in [Park's Lab](https://compbio.hms.harvard.edu/) 
at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/careers/postdoctoral-fellows/park-lab) at Harvard Medical School.

I won't write that much here. Just posting my projects on github, gitlab or elsewhere!
