# Welcome

My name is Giorgio, currently postdoc and data scientist in [Park's Lab](https://compbio.hms.harvard.edu/) 
at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/careers/postdoctoral-fellows/park-lab) at Harvard Medical School.

I won't write that much here. Just posting all my projects on github, gitlab or elsewhere!


### Precision Trial Designer

```markdown
In recent years, two new forms of clinical trial designs 
emerged in clinical cancer genomics: umbrella and basket trials. 
Designs of such trials can be extremely difficult, 
starting from the creation of a valid screening panel, 
to the optimization of sequencing space and to the calculation 
of a correct sample size for the trial. 
PTD provides a series of tools that can help bioinformaticians, 
clinicians and biostatisticians to design, 
analyze and finalize a custom gene panel for cancer genomics.
